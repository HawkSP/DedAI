## Introduction

DedAI v2 is a pioneering venture that leverages computational neuroscience and machine learning techniques to curate personalized music playlists based on real-time emotion detection through EEG (Electroencephalography) data. This project embodies the confluence of neuroaesthetics, the theory of emotional intelligence in music, and state-of-the-art AI algorithms.
